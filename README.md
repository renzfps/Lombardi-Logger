# Lombardi-Logger
Lombardi Dining Hall financial tracker that alleviates the pressure of having to manage your funds alone.

# Project Vision

- Track how much a student spends each day on average.
- Predict when their dining dollar balance will run out based on spending patterns.
- Adjust and recommend how much the student should spend each day to make their balance last through the rest of the semester.
- Categorize where money is spent (e.g., Mozzie’s, drinks, desserts, etc.).
- Provide staff with trends and item popularity to support better budgeting.

The primary goal of this product is for it to become an extension of the current Mobile Order app used on campus to order food.

# Current Stage

We are currently in the stage of setting everything up pre-code and gathering an understanding of the requirements to make the application successful and complete all of the requests of potential consumers.
