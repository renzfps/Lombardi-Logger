# Product Vision – Lombardi Logger

## Overview

Lombardi Logger is a Lombardi Dining Hall money tracker app designed to help students manage their dining dollars and track their daily spending habits. It predicts when their balance will run out and suggests how much they should spend each day so their funds last through the entire semester. It also gives staff useful insights into student purchasing trends.

## Problem Statement

Many students overspend at Lombardi Dining Hall without realizing how quickly their dining dollars are disappearing. I have many friends who's dining dollars have already expired, and there's another month left in the semester.
One of the reasons this happens is due to how difficult it is to manage your own dining dollars and how easy it is to overspend.

## Solution

Lombardi Logger will:

- Track individual student spending over time.
- Show daily, weekly, and overall spending trends.
- Predict when a student’s balance will reach zero if they keep their current spending habits.
- Suggest a new daily spending target if the student wants their money to last until the last day of the semester.
- Track where items are being purchased and which items are being purchsed most frequently.
- Provide staff with data on item popularity and trends.
